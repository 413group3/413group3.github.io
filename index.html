        Our goal is to create a companion app for board games that will allow people to play their favorite games without having to carry around a ton of dice and other common game accessories. The idea for our app is to have commonly used board game items like dice, counters, notepads, and other common tools available. <br>

        All of us will work on the programming at different times, and on different tasks so that all of our programming skills will be properly utilized throughout the semester. We will use Unity for our application. Unity will be used to leverage animations like the coin flip and dice roll. Unity can export to android and IOS.<br>

        There are already a few different board game companion apps but all of them focus on one game and are usually only usable for a single game. Our app will be usable for many different board games and wonâ€™t be marketed as a companion app for a single game. This will keep you from being forced to download a different app for every<br>
