<!-- Q1 -->
<p>&emsp;The GameM8 prototype that we used to run our studies was built in GameMaker: Studio, and sought to more accurately guide users through scenarios than our initial wireframing. We had several instances where navigation and functionality were unclear in our wireframes, despite having reasonable coverage of functionality and screens. We took professor feedback heavily into consideration whilst building the prototype, and we believe this led to a reasonable solution to many of the criticisms of certain use cases given in response to our initial plan. <br>

&emsp;Our primary usability study was to run users through a few essential scenarios regarding setting up games, connecting to games, using tools, and adjusting stats. Rather than pin down finer points of these processes, we built the prototype to ensure navigation through these scenarios was intuitive, and provided basic functionality for the essential process to give the user the impression of completing the task. In most cases if we were to move beyond a prototype, we would employ more typical components, especially data tables, where appropriate. Employing popular design components would have certainly aided in overall aesthetic and user perception, but we felt it necessary to address the primary concerns regarding navigation and basic manipulation as outlined in feedback on the midterm deliverable.<br>

&emsp;In an effort to be specific in addressing professor comments and to simultaneously display a few screens from the prototype, here are a few screenshots of our app with some brief commentary regarding what comments they address and what was changed.<br>

<br>
    
&emsp;Using a tool from a game session is now abundantly clear (a die, for example). From the main session screen, pressing the use a tool button brings the user to a screen with a dropdown containing all of the tools in the game profile. The user can select their desired tool, and a number of rolls if necessary for games that might require higher stats or multiples of a die. <br>

&emsp;Professor Hanrahan indicated some ambiguity regarding the difference between a game and a session. We took it upon ourselves to change the wording on the main menu screen to attempt to portray to the user that a session is the primary use case undertaken, which utilizes the game profiles accessed with a button separated from the session buttons. If literal confusion is an issue, sessions are instances of a game utilizing tools and stat tracking while game profiles are established groupings of tools and stats utilized in a session.<br>

<br>
    
&emsp;Joining a game session from the main menu has now been simplified. A user desiring to connect to an existing session will now need to input the name of the session they wish to connect to, as well as a password, and nothing more. Pressing attempt to connect will check for discrepancies in the credentials via the bluetooth connection and either add the user to a game session party or notify them of an error.<br>

&emsp;Professor Hanrahan rightfully cited a few issues with creating a new game session. We have since changed the game profile box to be a drop-down, which subsequently only includes profiles you have created. While we do not have a button on this screen to create a profile, this would give a first indication to a user that they may need to create a profile, and certainly in a future iteration it would not be difficult to provide an option to create or edit a profile from this screen.<br>

&emsp;Changing stats is not clear at all in our original wireframes. While the use of graphics is nice, we wanted to provide the opportunity during our scenarios to edit stats without worrying about the visual implications. For this, we included two side by side tables that would list out any players in a session and their stats and upon selecting both fields, a button that would allow the stats to be reassigned a new value.
    

<!-- Q2 -->
<br><br>&emsp;From here, let's discuss our target user population. We primarily targeted anyone who enjoys playing board games whether they be a casual player who picks one up every now and then or someone who plays them multiple times in a week. We wanted our app to be something that boardgame players of any kind could enjoy, so we didn&rsquo;t want to limit our apps usefulness to either hardcore or casual players. Our studies were valid in relation to this target audience because we got a wide range of players to take our survey. We had people filling out our survey who are die hard enthusiasts and people who play once a month if that. Our usability study fit our target audience less since it was just our classmates testing it out and none of them really played board games at all. Our interview with them after they used our application confirmed that they rarely if ever played board games so while they were able to provide good feedback on how well the app actually worked they didn&rsquo;t have much input on if they would like using it with a board-game or not.<br>

<!-- Q3 -->
&emsp;We were interested in understanding the current struggles of board game players, and we used our research questions to develop our hypothesis. We wanted to understand how the introduction of a board game companion app will change the experience of users&rsquo; gameplay. What technological alternatives to physical board game pieces would help users accomplish their tasks. We needed to understand the tedious tasks that board game users currently face that can be simplified with a board game app. These questions led us to our hypothesis that our app will simplify playing board games with your friends and make it an overall easier experience by eliminating the need to carry around dice, coins, and game score cards. To validate our hypothesis we conducted a survey, usability study, and informal interview after the usability study. The survey was beneficial because we learned what problems users currently face and we were able to validate if our solution would provide the tools users need to accomplish tasks. Most users thought that it was easier to use the physical tools rather than navigating through our app. This made us realize that in order for our app to be successful, we would need to have it be faster than the physical tools we were aiming to replace virtually. In addition, we learned what methods board game players currently use to track score and share with their friends. We used this information to design our system. Next, we performed our usability study, which also helped validate our research questions. During our usability study we learned of navigational design issues. After the usability study we had discussions with users to see what could make the experience better. We learned that technological alternatives to physical game pieces need to be very easy to use and need to be accessible very quickly. We were able to validate through our studies that our application would make it a better game experience for users by eliminating tedious tasks.<br>

<!-- Q4 -->
&emsp;For this project we primarily used surveys, wireframe critiques, and usability studies for our data collection. The first method that we implemented was a survey. We gathered participants by sending out the survey to our friend and social groups. .Our survey aimed at collecting a wide variety of information pertaining to playing board games. Our survey started out by asking introductory questions like &ldquo;How often do you play board games?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What kind of board games do you play?&rdquo;. These questions helped us understand what tools we would need to implement in our application. As an example, if someone often played a game that involved rolling a 20 sided die, then it would make sense to add that to our application. The next questions we asked related to usage of digital tools while playing board games. These questions related to how annoying using a phone is and other phone related problems. For these questions we came up with reasonable solutions like disabling notifications but since the app was not fully completed these solutions were not implemented. <br>

&emsp;The wireframe critiques help us iron out our initial designs for the application. This was performed in front of the IST 413 class and we used all the students and the professor as participants. This was incredibly useful because we got instant feedback on obvious design problems within our application. For example, our login screen allowed users to create an account. This did not make sense since a user who needed to create an account would not try to login in order to do accomplish that task. Instead we created a normal login sequence that allowed users to create an account on the home screen and not on the login screen. <br>

&emsp;In our usability analysis, we walked the participants through 4 of our major scenarios. For each of our participants, we had four classmates use our application. The scenarios included creating an account, creating a game session, creating a game tool set, and using a tool. These scenarios cover the basic usage of our application. The scenarios force the participant to use all of the features that we wanted to test. The main points that we took away from the test is that many of the features need to have additional navigation. One example is that if you forget to add a specific tool to a tool set and then start a game, you would have to restart the game, create a new tool set, and then recreate a game. This is an absurd thing to expect users to do, so we would need to revamp those systems.<br>

&emsp;The data we collected from the survey, and usability study was analyzed and used to help us design our application system. The survey results were analyzed on the google form platform. The answers to each question were displayed in different types of charts that we analyzed to make decisions about designing our application. We learned what tedious aspects of board games are the most tedious from our survey and we used this to consider our application features. Our analysis also showed that 65% of people surveyed would replace some aspects of a board game with their phone. This analysis showed that we needed to focus in on the few aspects rather than replace many parts of the board game users enjoy. A major concern users had with the use of a mobile app was they didn&rsquo;t want the application to use all of their battery. 82.5% of surveyed people answered that they are interested in a feature that allows them to share their player stats through their phone. The analysis of our survey results were very helpful for our design that we used in our usability study.<br>

&emsp;The usability study data collected was used to analyze where the major stops were in our application. We walked the users through the application as if they were playing a board game and closely recorded whether they were able to complete the tasks. We analyzed where the stops were occurring in our interface. After the usability study we analyzed what changes we could make to the application work better. When the users had to stop and think of what to do next, we recorded the location of the interface and analyzed what caused the problems and looked into alternative solutions. Our usability study was used to answer our research questions of how user can use technological alternatives to accomplish board game tasks. For one of our scenarios, we analyzed how users can quickly set up previously saved games. This feature functioned as a technological alternative to some of the physical game setup, which was reported in our survey as a tedious task. Our usability study analysis was very successful in helping us validate that our application would simplify some of the tedious tasks of playing board games.<br>
    
&emsp;Based on the feedback that we received from our early surveys and our studies, we felt that there are some features we could add and functionalities that could be simplified in future iterations of the app. One of the common results in the open ended questions from the survey regarding switching from using dice to using an app had to do with tradition and making the act of rolling dice feel more genuine. We felt that this would be an important stretch goal for the development of the application, because it is often very difficult to get the traditionalists to trade their dice and paper stat tracking for something new and modern. <br>
    
&emsp;We did some brainstorming about way that we could get more traditionalist potential users to give the app a try, and concluded that adding animations and possibly haptic feedback to the dice screen would make the act of rolling a dice feel less like a simulation. We also do not currently have a proper algorithm for random number generation, and this could be fixed relatively easily, as the issue had to due with the random number being generated only once, rather than once per iteration. <br>
    
&emsp;Our user studies gave us an idea of how easy the application was to use the first time through. Through conducting these studies, we discovered some issues with the navigation of our app when the user is performing certain actions. For example, we ran classmates through a scenario where they had to add a tool to an existing game profile. The classmates that were running through the scenarios found that it was tedious to have to navigate back to the starting screens in the application and essentially start a new game session in order to accomplish this task. These results made it clear that a future version of the application should include the ability to edit profiles and add tools at any time. <br>
    
&emsp;With the right changes and added features based on the feedback that we received, we feel that our application could meet the requirements of the potential users and accomplish our goal of creating a useful companion app that is more efficient than traditional dice rolling and paper stat tracking.<br>
