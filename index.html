<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Target Population</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The target population is anyone who plays tabletop games. Based on our survey the target age group is 15-25 years old. This includes games like Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the gathering, Settlers of Catan, and any other game. The target population must have access to a smartphone or tablet.</span></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><strong>Start and Join a Game Session</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michiko wants to play a game of Magic the Gathering with her friend Kosho. Both players have a smart device and agree to use the applications Game Session feature. Michiko starts the app and logs in. Next she clicks on &ldquo;Create Session&rdquo; and begins to fill out the form. She chooses her ideal MtG Game Profile and then clicks &ldquo;Create Session&rdquo;. Now the game session is ready to play and Kosho can join her. Kosho starts his app and logs in too. Instead of creating a game session, he clicks on join session. Kosho is presented with a screen showing the nearby game sessions available. He clicks on Michiko&rsquo;s session and is then shown a password screen. Michiko tells Kosho the password and now he is able to join the game session. The game session is now active and both players can see each player's health, card count, and mana count.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Edit game profile</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon is playing a modified version of the rogue character in Dungeons and Dragons, and he wants to use the game assistant application in order to help him keep track of his stats and dice rolls. He would like to use an existing profile that he can modify, rather than have to make one out of scratch. Jon opens a profile for the rogue class in the application, and he uses the &ldquo;add tool&rdquo; option to add another dice roll for the new ability that his modified rogue character has. Jon is then able to save the modified class and load it for his own use. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Load a game profile and flip a coin</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus is already playing Yu-gi-oh, and it requires the use of flipping a coin. Fortunately for Magnus, the game profile that he has loaded on the application has that feature. Magnus has already started the app, so he clicks on &ldquo;Game Profiles&rdquo; and then on &ldquo;Load Game&rdquo;. He selects &ldquo;Yu-gi-oh&rdquo; for the list of games and then clicks on &ldquo;Use a tool&rdquo;. Magnus is then presented with all the tools that his Yu-gi-oh game profile contains. He selects &ldquo;Flip Coin&rdquo; and then is shown an animation of a coin flipping. The coin lands on &ldquo;Heads&rdquo; and Magnus can continue the game. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Create custom game profile</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keiichi decided to make his own board game that he can play with his friends on the weekends. The game that he has created requires a lot of dice rolls. Rather than go out and buy a ton of dice, he decides that it would be way easier to take advantage of the fact that him and his friends all have access to Android smartphones that they can download the game assistant application on. Keiichi then decides that he can just make a profile in the application that includes the dice required for the game, so that they can all be rolled at once, digitally. In order to do this, he accesses the game submenu and selects &ldquo;create game.&rdquo; Once he does this, Keiichi is able to give the game a name and add tools for the various dice needed in order to make the game work. Once he is done adding the necessary tools, he is able to save the profile and access it at any time by using the &ldquo;load&rdquo; option in the games submenu. Keiichi then shares the profile with his friends so that they can each access the profile on their own phones. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hypothesis</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our hypothesis is that our app will simplify playing board games with your friends and make it an overall easier experience by eliminating the need to carry around dice, character sheets, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our usability study aims to test this hypothesis by having board game players with varying age and play experience test our app for ease of use. If our hypothesis is correct users should find the app streamlined enough that it is less of a hassle to set up and play a game via the app as opposed to the traditional method. We will also test the ease of use of resuming a game in progress, because our app also aims to make it easier to pick your games back up after leaving them for awhile by storing all your game information in one convenient place, as well as storing all the tools that the players would be using for the game. Based on the feedback as well as our observations as the users perform our study we hope to prove that our app makes the tabletop experience easier for players. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Data Collection Plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first data collection method that we plan to use is having our test subjects sit down and play a game using the app and every time they need to use the app we will have the comment on the process as they go. This will include having our subjects set up a game from scratch, so that they can also comment on the ease of use of setting up a game. About half way through the game we will ask the users to stop playing, save their game in the app, close the app, and put away the game. They will then go through the process of starting up the game again using the app and comment on how easy or difficult it is to resume playing a game while using our app. While playing we want our test subjects to be actively commenting on the process of using the app. This way we can get live feedback of how they feel about it&rsquo;s usefulness instead of having them fill out a survey or questionnaire at the end and being forced to reflect back on it&rsquo;s usefulness. Observing them as they use it also has the bonus of allowing us to observe their body language and facial expressions so we can see if they are getting frustrated with the app even if they aren&rsquo;t vocalizing the frustrations to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our second method of data collection will be having two groups playing the same game simultaneously, one of them using the app, and the other playing the normal method. This will allow us to have a control group so that we can get better data on the usefulness of our app. While these groups are playing we will record data about the time it takes both groups to set up a game, time spent using tools, time it takes to put the game away, and finally the time it takes for both groups to resume playing a game after putting it away. We will also be observing both groups closely to try and pick up on the relative ease of use of the app compared to the traditional method, and at the end we will ask the group to rate their experience using the app, if they would like to use it again in future games, and if they had trouble with it do they think further use would improve their enjoyment of it. This method should give us good data on if the app is actually improving on the traditional methods of playing board games as well as people&rsquo;s overall opinions of the app after using it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get subjects for our research we will start by asking the people who filled out the survey if they would be willing to continue adding us in our research by playing a game with the app. This will give the added bonus of seeing if anyone who said they would never use a companion app like this for a board game changed their mind after using it. If we do not get enough people for an adequate sample size from the people who filled out the survey we will ask around our friend groups, or people in our IST 413 class if they would be willing to participate. This should give us a relatively diverse sample for our research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will include your survey and two data collection methods of your choosing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide detailed descriptions of the justification the two research methods and how they will help you answer your research questions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describe how you will recruit participants for surveys, and the two additional research methods</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Data Analysis Plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first method of data collection we are focusing on collecting live feedback. We are going to transfer our notes taken into an excel spreadsheet. We will organize our notes into certain categories and the categories will be put in the columns. The information we are looking to analyze will be how often the user had to stop and think. This will be very important to understand how easy the user thinks it is to set up a game. We also will display the amount of the times they were completely stopped and could not figure out how what to do. This category is very important because it will reveal our major blockers that we need to fix. Using our notes we will determine whether the user was able to accomplish the scenario that we created for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next usability method focuses on comparing our app to the normal method of the game. Our analysis plan will be done in excel as well, but we are going to be comparing more information. We will compare the times that it takes each group to &nbsp;set up a game, time spent using tools, time it takes to put the game away, and finally the time it takes for both groups to resume playing a game after putting it away. We expect that the group using our app will take less time than the other group, and through analysis we will see in what areas our app can decrease game time and increase game flow speed. We will also be analyzing if our app causes more blockers for the user. At the end, when we ask each user to rate their experience using the app, if they would like to use it again in future games, and if they had trouble with it do they think further use would improve their enjoyment of it. Analysis of these questions will prove whether our app has a positive experience. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prototype</strong></h3>
    
<img src="Prototype.png" alt="Prototype" width="100%" height="100%">
  
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wireframes we had were created in draw.io. They represent a rudimentary mapping of our app, and form a foundation for us to begin to develop it. Any addressment of layout and functionality will not be done by examining or showing these wireframes, but rather will come from analysis of the actual application we intend to develop as our primary next step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than continue to elaborate on our wireframes, we intend to implement the core use cases of our app by developing it in GameMaker: Studio. Setting up the core functionality in a real environment will save us the time of recreating our wireframes in an interactive tool, and give us better data on the usability of our app through real interaction. Where a simple information retrieval or storage app might be able to get accurate usability data from a prototype, we feel the only way to really capture the essence of our application and do justice to testing our hypothesis is by having a real application that participants playing games can use. Data we collect from our experiments on how usable the application is should face little restriction in that iterations of the app in GameMaker: Studio will be very quick and straightforward. By not having an intermediate prototyping tool from our initial wireframes, we will be able to judge feedback and changes, even within the span of a test, for before and after comparison. </span></p>
