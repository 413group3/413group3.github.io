        The Winners <br>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Purpose Statement:</FONT><br>
        Our goal is to create a companion app for board games that will allow people to play their favorite games without having to carry around a ton of dice and other common game accessories. The idea for our app is to have commonly used board game items like dice, counters, notepads, and other common tools available. <br>   
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Members:</FONT><br>
        Dan: Presenting and public speaking, documentation and organization. Java programming. <br>
        Yusef: Presenting, logic, documentation, art/graphics, ui design. testing<br>
        Ben: Website management, art direction, ui design, ux<br>
        Lane: Agile project management, User experience testing, Java <br>
        Jake: Writing scripts, building objects<br>
        Jason: Backend logic and coding<br>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Application Type:</FONT><br>  
        It will be a mobile app. The app is intended to be used on smartphones and easily accessible during a board game and/or card game session.<br>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Development Plan:</FONT><br> 
        All of us will work on the programming at different times, and on different tasks so that all of our programming skills will be properly utilized throughout the semester. We will use Unity for our application. Unity will be used to leverage animations like the coin flip and dice roll. Unity can export to android and IOS.<br>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Compared to Existing Tech:</FONT><br>     
        There are already a few different board game companion apps but all of them focus on one game and are usually only usable for a single game. Our app will be usable for many different board games and wonâ€™t be marketed as a companion app for a single game. This will keep you from being forced to download a different app for every game you play and save storage space on your phone. Our application will have features like dice rolling, coin flipping, and stat tracking bundled together in one, easy to use app.<br>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00000" face=bebas size=15>Hypotheses:</FONT><br> 
        After the first iteration, we will need to find and observe subjects utilizing the application in games in order to assess whether the app is useful and/or used as intended. In general, our hypotheses should be along the lines of: Using this application makes playing board and other games quicker and easier.<br>
